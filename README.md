# code-refactor-seo

## This project involved going into the HTML file and adding semantic tags and changing the class/id tags to fit the website more adaptivly . this also includes going into the css file and making sure all changes with the html classes where also fixed and condenced within the css file. In conclusion, the website now functions properly as it is needed to be. All links jump to the correct area of the website, there are no repeating css code that is unwarrented ,and it looks the same as when we began.
